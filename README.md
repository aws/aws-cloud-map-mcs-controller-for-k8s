## Introduction
The AWS Cloud Map Multi-cluster Service Discovery Controller for Kubernetes (K8s) implements the Kubernetes [KEP-1645: Multi-Cluster Services API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-multicluster/1645-multi-cluster-services-api) and [KEP-2149: ClusterId for ClusterSet identification](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-multicluster/2149-clusterid), which allows services to communicate across multiple clusters. The implementation relies on [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) for enabling cross-cluster service discovery.

## Installation

Perform the following installation steps on each participating cluster.

- For multi-cluster service discovery and consumption, the controller should be installed on a minimum of 2 EKS clusters.
- Participating clusters should be provisioned into a single AWS account, within a single AWS region.

### Dependencies

#### Network

> âš  **The AWS Cloud Map MCS Controller for K8s provides service discovery and communication across multiple clusters, therefore implementations depend on end-end network connectivity between workloads provisioned within each participating cluster.** 

- In deployment scenarios where participating clusters are provisioned into separate VPCs, connectivity will depend on correctly configured  [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html), [inter-VPC routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-routing.html), and Security Group configuration. The [VPC Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/getting-started.html) can be used to test and validate end-end connectivity between worker nodes within each cluster.
- Undefined behavior may occur if controllers are deployed without the required network connectivity between clusters.

#### Configure CoreDNS

Install the CoreDNS multicluster plugin into each participating cluster. The multicluster plugin enables CoreDNS to lifecycle manage DNS records for `ServiceImport` objects.

To install the plugin, run the following commands.

```bash
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/samples/coredns-clusterrole.yaml"
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/samples/coredns-configmap.yaml"
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/samples/coredns-deployment.yaml"
```

### Install Controller

To install the latest release of the controller, run the following commands.

> **_NOTE:_** AWS region environment variable can be _optionaly_ set like `export AWS_REGION=us-west-2` Otherwise the controller will infer region in the order `AWS_REGION` environment variable, ~/.aws/config file, then EC2 metadata (for EKS environment)

```sh
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/config/controller_install_release"
```

> ðŸ“Œ See [Releases](#Releases) section for details on how to install other versions.

The controller must have sufficient IAM permissions to perform required Cloud Map operations. Grant IAM access rights `AWSCloudMapFullAccess` to the controller Service Account to enable the controller to manage Cloud Map resources.

## Usage

### Configure `cluster.clusterset.k8s.io` and `clusterset.k8s.io`

`cluster.clusterset.k8s.io` is a unique identifier for the cluster.

`clusterset.k8s.io` is an identifier that relates to the `ClusterSet` in which the cluster belongs. 

```yaml
apiVersion: about.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProperty
metadata:
  name: cluster.clusterset.k8s.io
spec:
  value: [Your Cluster identifier]
---
apiVersion: about.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProperty
metadata:
  name: clusterset.k8s.io
spec:
  value: [Your ClusterSet identifier]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: about.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProperty
metadata:
  name: cluster.clusterset.k8s.io
spec:
  value: my-first-cluster
---
apiVersion: about.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProperty
metadata:
  name: clusterset.k8s.io
spec:
  value: my-clusterset
```

### Export services

Then assuming you already have a Service installed, apply a `ServiceExport` yaml to the cluster in which you want to export a service. This can be done for each service you want to export.

```yaml
kind: ServiceExport
apiVersion: multicluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  namespace: [Your service namespace here]
  name: [Your service name]
```

**Example:** This will export a service with name *my-amazing-service* in namespace *hello*
```yaml
kind: ServiceExport
apiVersion: multicluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  namespace: hello
  name: my-amazing-service
```

*See the `samples` directory for a set of example yaml files to set up a service and export it. To apply the sample files run the following commands.*

```sh
kubectl create namespace example
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/samples/example-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/samples/example-service.yaml
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/samples/example-serviceexport.yaml
```

### Import services

In your other cluster, the controller will automatically sync services registered in AWS Cloud Map by applying the appropriate `ServiceImport`. To list them all, run the following command.
```sh
kubectl get ServiceImport -A
```

## Releases

AWS Cloud Map MCS Controller for K8s adheres to the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) specification. Each release updates the major version tag (eg. `vX`), a major/minor version tag (eg. `vX.Y`) and a major/minor/patch version tag (eg. `vX.Y.Z`). To see a full list of all releases, refer to our [Github releases page](https://github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/releases).

> **_NOTE:_** AWS region environment variable can be _optionally_ set like `export AWS_REGION=us-west-2` Otherwise controller will infer region in the order `AWS_REGION` environment variable, ~/.aws/config file, then EC2 metadata (for EKS environment)

The following command format is used to install from a particular release.
```sh
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/config/controller_install_release[?ref=*git version tag*]"
```

Run the following command to install the latest release.
```sh
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/config/controller_install_release"
```

The following example will install release v0.1.0.
```sh
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/config/controller_install_release?ref=v0.1.0"
```

We also maintain a `latest` tag, which is updated to stay in line with the `main` branch. We **do not** recommend installing this on any production cluster, as any new major versions updated on the `main` branch will introduce breaking changes.

To install from `latest` tag run the following command.
```sh
kubectl apply -k "github.com/aws/aws-cloud-map-mcs-controller-for-k8s/config/controller_install_latest"
```
